    help
        Enable this option only when the SD card chip-select line is wired
        directly to an ESP32-S3 GPIO. The default configuration relies on the
        CH422G expander (EXIO4) and does not require an extra wire.

    default 34
    help
        Physical GPIO used to drive the SD card chip-select when bypassing the
        CH422G expander. Waveshare spare headers expose GPIO34 which is safe to
        use without conflicting with the RGB data bus.
