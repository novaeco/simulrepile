        Select this option when the SD card chip-select signal is routed
        through the external IO expander shipped with the Waveshare ESP32-S3
        board.  Disable the option to bypass the expander and drive the CS
        line directly from an ESP32-S3 GPIO for diagnostic purposes.

        GPIO used to directly control the SD card chip-select when the IO
        expander is bypassed.  Ensure the selected pin is not used by other
        peripherals.
